\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

FIXME MCD = multilevel constraint decomposition, a multigrid \cite{Trottenbergetal2001} method basically by \cite{Tai2003} for obstacle problems; see \cite{Bueler2022};  obstacle problem view first extended to Stokes by \cite{WirbelJarosch2020};  The computations in this paper use the Python FE library Firedrake \cite{Rathgeberetal2016}, which applies an embedded domain language \cite{Alnaesetal2014} to convert weak forms into discrete equations which are solved in parallel using the PETSc \cite{Balayetal2020} library.


\section{The steady ice geometry problem} \label{sec:stokesgeometry}

The standard model for determining the geometry of glaciers is based in part upon a dynamical description of ice flow, namely a shear-thinning version of the Stokes equations.  This Glen-Stokes ice-dynamics model can only determine the free-surface glacier geometry when it is combined with the surface kinematical equation (SKE) and a form of climate input, namely the rate of accumulation of snow or ablation, i.e.~melting and runoff.  In this section we state the strong form of this ``coupled'' glacier geometry model in the steady-state case, which we call the steady ice geometry problem (SIGP).  The emphasis here is on the complementarity-problem nature of the SIGP, often not explicit in the glaciers literature (e.g.~as observed by \cite{SchoofHewitt2013}).  We then define its weak form, noting along the way several unknown aspects of the theory.  Section \ref{sec:evolution} gives the straightfoward extension of the steady case to a time-discretized evolving-geometry model, the implicit ice geometry problem (IIGP).

The SIGP is defined on a fixed, bounded map-plane region $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ (Figure \ref{fig:stokesdomain}).  We denote the map-plane variables as $x$ when $d=1$ and $x,y$ when $d=2$.  On $\Omega$ we assume that a climatic mass balance (CMB) function $a(x,y)$ is defined at every point, whether or not ice is present at that location.  In ice-free areas this function could be described as the ``potential'' CMB, namely the annual balance of snow accumulation and potential melt if ice were present \cite{Cogleyetal2011}, e.g.~as computed by energy balance in a climate or weather model.  Here we assume $a$ has units of ice thickness per time, equivalently ice volume per area (in $\Omega$) per time, compatible with our assumption of constant ice density below.  Also we assume there is a bed elevation function $b(x,y)$ defined everywhere on $\Omega$, which determines the topography upon which the glacier sits.  The functions $a$ and $b$ are the data (inputs) of the SIGP.

\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{In the steady ice geometry problem (SIGP) the CMB $a$ (arrows; downward $=$ accumulation) and bed elevation $b$ (solid) are given on a fixed map-plane region $\Omega \subset \RR^d$.  The solution includes a surface elevation $s$ (dashed) on $\Omega$; note $s=b$ where ice-free.  The ice velocity $\bu$ and pressure $p$ are defined in the icy domain: $\Lambda_s = \{(x,y,z)\,:\,b(x,y) < z < s(x,y)\} \subset \RR^{d+1}$.}
\label{fig:stokesdomain}
\end{figure}

The Glen-Stokes dynamical model, the so-called stress balance, for ice only applies in the icy domain in $\RR^{d+1}$.  We make a strong, but common \cite[for example]{IsaacStadlerGhattas2015,Jouvetetal2008,Lengetal2012,WirbelJarosch2020} assumption this this icy domain has a well-defined upper surface elevation, a function $s(x,y)$.  That is, we assume there are \emph{no overhangs}, and that the under-side of the ice is in contact with the bed $b$.  We then define $s$ everywhere in $\Omega$ by extending with $s=b$ where ice is absent, thus $s\ge b$ applies on $\Omega$.  Note that $s$ is part of the model solution; it is not given data.

However, as a consequence of the no-overhangs assumption, the SIGP as described here is likely not to be well-posed because of an issue at the ice margin.  There may be no steady state because the fluid in the vicinity of a steep ice margin, especially on a steep bed feature, ``wants'' to generate an overhang, violating the assumption that $s$ is well-defined.  Furthermore the same concern applies to each time step of an evolving model; the model does not stop overhangs from appearing at the margin.  However, because overhangs are small features in large glaciers and ice sheets, essentially all modeling literature ignores this possibility and assumes well-defined surface elevation and thickness \cite{Jouvetetal2008,Lengetal2012,WirbelJarosch2020}.  An exception is \cite{PralongFunk2005}, who furthermore suggest a potentially well-posed continuum model, a nontrivial extension of the one here, in which serac and ice-cliff calving occurs via a damage variable and a stress-fracture failure criterion.  This extended model also explains one of our numerical boundary variants, a short, fixed-height cliff (Section \ref{sec:mcdstokes}), but overhangs are not allowed in any of our numerical constructions.

Based on the assumption of a well-defined upper surface, we define the (solution) extent of the ice as the open set
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_s = \{(x,y,z)\,|\,(x,y) \in \Omega \,\text{ and }\, b(x,y) < z < s(x,y)\}  \subset \RR^{d+1}, \label{eq:lambdas}
\end{equation}
where $z$ is vertically-upward.  (If $d=1$ then coordinates are ``$(x,z)$'' on $\Lambda_s$.)  The map-plane region $\Omega$ need not be connected or simply-connected, but even if so the solution set $\Lambda_s$ need not be.  However, $\Lambda_s$ has the topology of the product of an open subset of $\Omega$ and an interval, and we will approximate it using an extruded mesh (Section \ref{sec:fe}).

For a given geometry $\Lambda_s$, we model the ice as a very-viscous \cite{Acheson1990}, non-Newtonian fluid subject to Glen's shear-thinning flow law \cite{GreveBlatter2009}; see also \cite[Chapter 1]{FowlerNg2021}.  Allowing any Glen exponent $n\ge 1$, the equations inside $\Lambda_s$ are
\begin{align}
- \nabla \cdot \tau + \nabla p &= \rhoi \bg &&\text{\emph{stress balance}} \label{eq:forcebalance} \\
\nabla \cdot \bu &= 0 &&\text{\emph{incompressibility}} \label{eq:incompressible} \\
\tau &= B_n |D\bu|^{(1/n) - 1} D\bu  &&\text{\emph{flow law}} \label{eq:viscflowlaw}
\end{align}
The solution fields here are the velocity $\bu$, pressure $p$, and deviatoric stress $\tau$.  Equations \eqref{eq:forcebalance} and \eqref{eq:viscflowlaw} form the momentum conservation (stress balance) model, while \eqref{eq:incompressible} is an aspect of our mass conservation model.  As seen below, mass conservation on the free surface of $\Lambda_s$ requires an additional equation \eqref{eq:ske}.

Regarding tensors and their notation, recall that the (Cauchy) stress tensor $\sigma$ decomposes into the deviatoric part $\tau$ minus the pressure, i.e.~$\sigma = \tau - p\,I$, so equation \eqref{eq:forcebalance} simply says $-\Div \sigma = \rhoi \bg$.  The strain rate tensor $D\bu$ is the symmetric part of $\grad \bu$, $D\bu = \frac{1}{2} \left(\grad\bu + \grad\bu^\top\right)$, and the tensor norm used in \eqref{eq:viscflowlaw} satisfies $|D\bu|^2 = \frac{1}{2} (D\bu)_{ij} (D\bu)_{ij}$.  Because $D\bu$ is symmetric, and because it has trace zero by equation \eqref{eq:incompressible}, i.e.~$\trace(D\bu)=\nabla \cdot \bu = 0$, equation \eqref{eq:viscflowlaw} implies that $\tau$ is also symmetric with trace zero, thus that $p=-(d+1)^{-1} \trace \sigma$.

In computations we will use constants $n=3$, ice density $\rhoi=910 \,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^{-3}$ \cite{Huybrechtsetal1996}, and gravity $\bg=\left<0,0,-g\right>$, with $g=9.81\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-2}$.  The ice hardness $B_n$ is a constant because we assume isothermal conditions \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, with $B_3=6.8082\times 10^7\,\text{Pa}\,\text{s}^{1/3}$ \cite{Huybrechtsetal1996}.

For the $n=1$ (Newtonian) Stokes equations one would write \eqref{eq:viscflowlaw} as $\tau = 2\nu D\bu$ with viscosity $\nu>0$, but exponents $n>1$ imply an effective viscosity function of $|D\bu|$.  This would thus be singular in the limit of small strain rates, and so, motivated by the actual finite viscosity of glacier ice \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, we define the regularized effective viscosity
\begin{equation}
\nu_\eps = \frac{1}{2} B_n \left(|D\bu|^2 + \eps\, D_0^2\right)^{(\pp-2)/2}, \label{eq:regeffvisc}
\end{equation}
where $\pp=(1/n)+1$, with $\pp=4/3$ in computations.  The constant $D_0$ defines a strain-rate scale for glacier flow; $D_0 = 1 \,\text{a}^{-1}$ and $\eps = 10^{-4}$ are used here.  Also we eliminate $\tau$ and rewrite \eqref{eq:forcebalance} as $- \nabla \cdot \left(2 \nu_\eps\, D\bu\right) + \nabla p = \rhoi \mathbf{g}$, with a vector $p$-Laplacian as the leading-order term.

Our SIGP model uses dynamic boundary conditions for isolated, grounded, and non-sliding ice.  In addition to the already-stated assumption that the top and bottom boundaries of $\Lambda_s$ can be identified, we further assume these surfaces have well-defined tangents.  On the upper free surface we set a condition of zero applied stress,
\begin{equation}
\left(2 \nu_\eps D\bu - pI\right) \bn_s = \bzero  \qquad \qquad \text{\emph{top} } \overline{\partial} \Lambda_s \label{eq:topbc}
\end{equation}
where $\bn_s$ is any normal to $\overline{\partial} \Lambda_s$.  (Providing a nonzero atmospheric pressure at the surface is straightforward, but it has no important consequence.)  On the base we impose no slip:
\begin{equation}
\bu = \bzero  \qquad\qquad \text{\emph{base} } \underline{\partial} \Lambda_s. \label{eq:basebc}
\end{equation}

Note that the ice flow extends in the horizontal direction until a free boundary at the glacier margin is reached, and the surface gradient $\grad s$ may become singular there, but the top and bottom surfaces are assumed to meet at the margin (Figure \ref{fig:stokesdomain}).  An alternative geometry with a small cliff is also considered (Section \ref{sec:fe}).  Real glacier margins may indeed occur as fracture-generated cliffs \cite{PralongFunk2005}, but fracture processes are not modeled here.

The well-posedness of the above dynamics model, for fixed domain $\Lambda_s$, is proven by \cite{JouvetRappaz2011}, and the solution is a unique pair $(\bu,p)$ defined on $\Lambda_s$.  (The function spaces are identified below when stating the weak formulation.)  However, the simultaneous determination of $\Lambda_s$ and $(\bu,p)$ is the goal of the SIGP model.  Indeed, the above equations make no reference to the climate input function $a$, so we need another ``equation'', which we will see is actually an inequality.

\newcommand{\bus}{\bu|_s}

Noting that the surface elevation is already defined on all of $\Omega$, with $s=b$ off the ice, we also extend the surface normal $\bn_s$, thus we set
\begin{equation}
\bn_s = \left<-s_x,-s_y,1\right> \label{eq:surfacenormal}
\end{equation}
so that the (un-normalized) surface normal is specified almost everywhere on $\Omega$.  (By contrast, note that the dynamical boundary condition \eqref{eq:topbc} applies only on top of the ice.)  Furthermore we extend the surface value of the velocity to all of $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\bus(x,y) = \begin{cases} \bu(x,y,s(x,y)), & s(x,y) > b(x,y), \\
                     \bzero, & \text{elsewhere}. \end{cases} \label{eq:surfacevelocity}
\end{equation}
(The movement of the solid earth would determine $\bu|_b \ne 0$, thus $\bu|_s$ could be nonzero in ice-free areas, and a more-complete model could include this small effect.)

The steady-state surface kinematical equation (SKE) \cite[see equation (5.21)]{GreveBlatter2009} is the needed additional aspect of mass conservation:
\begin{equation}
\bus \cdot \bn_s + a = 0 \qquad \text{\emph{on the ice}}. \label{eq:ske}
\end{equation}
Note that $a(x,y)$ is the \emph{vertical} ice thickness added per time.  (Some references use a distinct quantity, namely the thickness added perpendicularly to the ice surface \cite{GreveBlatter2009}, which is significantly different if the gradient $\grad s$ is large.)

While the involved quantities are defined everywhere, kinematical balance \eqref{eq:ske} applies only \emph{on} the ice.  However $\bus \cdot \bn_s + a \le 0$ everywhere in $\Omega$ because $a$ is nonpositive in steady state in ice-free locations.  In fact, when combined with the constraint that $s\ge b$ everywhere on $\Omega$, SKE \eqref{eq:ske} is part of an infinite-dimensional nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) \cite{Bueler2021conservation}.  Recall that an NCP on a finite-dimensional vector space $V=\RR^k$ combines the three statements $x\ge 0$, $F(x)\ge 0$, and $x F(x)=0$, where $F:V\to V$ \cite{FacchineiPang2003}.

We may now state the strong form of the SIGP as follows:
\begin{align}
s - b &\ge 0 && \text{on $\Omega$} \label{eq:strongform} \\
- \bu|_s \cdot \bn_s - a &\ge 0 && \text{\emph{same}} \notag \\
(s - b) (- \bu|_s \cdot \bn_s - a) &= 0 && \text{\emph{same}} \notag \\
- \nabla \cdot \left(2 \nu_\eps\, D\bu\right) + \nabla p - \rhoi \mathbf{g} &= \bzero && \text{on $\Lambda_s$} \notag \\
\nabla \cdot \bu &= 0 && \text{\emph{same}} \notag \\
\left(2 \nu_\eps D\bu - pI\right) \bn_s &= \bzero && \text{on $\overline{\partial} \Lambda_s$} \notag \\
\bu &= \bzero && \text{on $\underline{\partial} \Lambda_s$} \notag
\end{align}
(Definition \eqref{eq:regeffvisc} is also needed.)  The first three statements in \eqref{eq:strongform} form the NCP, but it is coupled to the dynamical boundary value problem formed by the last four statements.

The solution of \eqref{eq:strongform} is a triple of functions $s(x,y)$, $\bu(x,y,z)$, $p(x,y,z)$.  However, as the domain on which $\bu,p$ are defined is only known via the solution elevation $s$, \eqref{eq:strongform} is at best an incomplete description.  The weak form in the next section, using a $s\mapsto \bu|_s$ solution operator, will partially address this concern.  Whether in strong or weak form, this inequality-constrained system of PDEs has a largely-unknown theory regarding well-posedness and solution regularity.  However, certain well-posedness theory is known for the SIA version of this problem, with existence established by \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, and uniqueness in the flat bed case.

In Sections \ref{sec:fe}--\ref{sec:mcdstokes} we will construct and demonstrate a robust multilevel scheme for the numerical solution of the SIGP weak form (Section \ref{sec:weakido}).  As noted in Section \ref{sec:intro}, numerical solutions have traditionally applied explicit time-stepping, even when computing steady states, splitting the dynamics and the SKE into sub-steps and using truncation to address the NCP \cite[for example]{Jouvetetal2008,Lengetal2012}.  By contrast, the implicit time-stepping model in Section \ref{sec:evolution} avoids time-splitting and is unconditionally stable.


\section{Weak form and the ice dynamics operator} \label{sec:weakido}

The weak form of the fixed-geometry Glen-Stokes model for ice flow, which extends the linear Stokes weak form \cite{Elmanetal2014} to regularized power-law rheology, is relatively well-known \cite{IsaacStadlerGhattas2015,JouvetRappaz2011,Lengetal2012}, and we summarize it here.  Then we will address the weak form of the SIGP.

Denote by $W^{\text{k},\text{r}}$ the Sobolev space \cite{Evans2010} of functions with $k$ derivatives which are $r$th-power integrable.  Suppose for the moment that $\Lambda \subset \RR^{d+1}$ is a fixed, bounded domain on which we prescribe a Dirchlet condition $\bu=0$ on some positive-measure portion of the boundary, and otherwise suppose the boundary is stress-free (Neumann boundary).  Let $\pp=(1/n)+1$ as in \eqref{eq:regeffvisc}, and let $\qq=(1-\pp^{-1})^{-1}=n+1$ be the conjugate exponent; $\pp=4/3$ and $\qq = 4$ if $n=3$.  Let $W_0^{1,\pp}(\Lambda)^{d+1}$ be the space of velocity functions, zero along the Dirichlet boundary, and
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{M}_{\text{GS}} = W_0^{1,\pp}(\Lambda)^{d+1} \times L^\qq(\Lambda)  \label{eq:mixed}
\end{equation}
be the (mixed) space of admissible velocity and pressure pairs.  The Glen-Stokes weak form is the statement that $(\bu,p) \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{GS}}$ should satisfy
\begin{equation}
F_{\text{GS}}(\bu,p)[\bv,q] = \int_\Lambda 2 \nu_\eps D\bu : D\bv - p \Div\bv - (\Div\bu) q - \rhoi \bg \cdot \bv\,d\bx = 0 \label{eq:glenstokesweak}
\end{equation}
for all $(\bv,q) \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{GS}}$.

Jouvet and Rappaz \cite{JouvetRappaz2011} prove that this Glen-Stokes formulation is well-posed under the above assumptions if also the Neumann boundary is $C^1$.  In particular they show \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} is equivalent to minimization of a convex and coercive functional over the divergence-free subspace, but also that there is a unique pressure $p\in L^\qq(\Lambda)$.

However, we seek to go beyond this dynamical problem on predetermined ice geometry.  We are interested in finding a triple $s,\bu,p$ which solves \eqref{eq:strongform}, or rather its weak form which we now propose.  Again suppose $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ is a fixed map-plane domain with $C^1$ boundary, and that the bed elevation $b$ is in $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$.  Because of the $C^1$ boundary, the Sobolev space $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$ supports a linear trace operator which defines $f|_{\partial \Omega}$ for $f \in W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$ \cite[Section 5.5]{Evans2010}.  Let
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K} = \{s \in W^{1,\qq}(\Omega) \,:\, s \ge b \, \text{ and } \, s\big|_{\partial\Omega} = b\big|_{\partial\Omega}\}  \label{eq:Kconstraintset}
\end{equation}
be the closed and convex set of admissible surface elevations of an isolated glacier or ice sheet.  However, it is not clear that the correct Sobolev space has been identified in \eqref{eq:Kconstraintset}, and in fact we must further suppose that
\begin{equation}
s\in \mathcal{K} \text{ defines an icy domain } \Lambda_s \text{ which has a $C^1$ free surface.} \label{eq:quixotic}
\end{equation}
Quixotic assumption \eqref{eq:quixotic} would follow from a sufficiently-strong regularity result for the theory of the current paper, which we cannot offer.  However, the existing theory of shallow ice sheet well-posedness \cite{JouvetBueler2012} includes a version of definition \eqref{eq:Kconstraintset},\footnote{In \cite{JouvetBueler2012} the $2\qq/(\qq-1)=8/3$ power of the ice thickness is in $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$.} and in that shallow theory $s$ solves an elliptic equation and is thus smooth, at least interior to the free boundary.

We may now define the ice dynamics operator (IDO), a map using the trace of the velocity solution to the Glen-Stokes problem above (Figure \ref{fig:idoaction}).  For each surface elevation function $s \in \mathcal{K}$ the IDO result $\Phi(s)$ is the normal component of the upper-surface trace of the unique velocity solution $\bu$ of \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} over the icy domain $\Lambda_s$, but extended by zero to all of $\Omega$:
\begin{equation}
\Phi(s) = \begin{cases} \bu|_{\overline{\partial} \Lambda_s} \cdot \bn_s, & s > b, \\
                        0, & \text{otherwise}, \end{cases} \label{eq:ido}
\end{equation}
where $\bu|_{\overline{\partial} \Lambda_s}$ denotes a trace operator on $W^{1,\pp}(\Lambda_s)^{d+1}$; compare \eqref{eq:mixed}.  Note that the output $\Phi(s)$, a scalar function on $\Omega$, may jump or have other singularities at the glacier margin, but we will only need $\Phi(s)$ to be in the dual of $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$, thus permitting substantial irregularities.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{genfigs/idoaction.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The ice dynamics operator $\Phi$ maps the surface elevation $s$ (dashed) to the normal ice surface motion $\Phi(s)=\bu|_s \cdot \bn_s$; the thin line is $s+\Phi(s)$.  Both input and output are defined on all of $\Omega$.}
\label{fig:idoaction}
\end{figure}

Using the IDO, and recalling that the CMB $a$ is defined on all of $\Omega$, we may immediately re-write the \eqref{eq:strongform} in a simpler strong form, namely an NCP with a hidden dynamical problem:
\begin{align}
s - b &\ge 0  \label{eq:idostrongform} \\
- \Phi(s) - a &\ge 0 \notag \\
(s - b) (- \Phi(s) - a) &= 0 \notag
\end{align}
Here the statements hold on all of $\Omega$ and the data $a,b$ are clear.  The solution is the ice surface $z=s(x,y)$, but $\bu,p$ are hidden variables within the evaluation of $\Phi(s)$.

For $s \in \mathcal{K}$ and $r \in W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$ we next define a functional which is nonlinear in $s$:
\begin{equation}
F(s)[r] = - \ip{\Phi(s)}{r} = - \int_\Omega \Phi(s)\, r \,dx dy. \label{eq:sigpfunctional}
\end{equation}
One computes $F(s)[r]$ by defining the icy domain $\Lambda_s$ \eqref{eq:lambdas}, then solving the (weak form) Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak}, then evaluating the normal component of the surface trace of the velocity \eqref{eq:ido} to compute the IDO $\Phi(s)$, and then integrating the result against the test function $r$.  Implicit in \eqref{eq:sigpfunctional} is that $\Phi(s)$ has minimal regularity; it need only be in the dual space of $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$.

Finally, the SIGP weak form is the following variational inequality (VI) \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980} which should determine $s\in\mathcal{K}$:
\begin{equation}
F(s)[r - s] \ge \ip{a}{r-s} \quad \text{for all $r \in \mathcal{K}$.}  \label{eq:sigpweakform}
\end{equation}
This VI has a shallow (SIA) analog, for which existence has been proven \cite{JouvetBueler2012}, but in that case the functional is an integral of powers of the thickness $s-b$ and the surface slope $\grad s$, thus locally-computable.  Here, by contrast, the computation of \eqref{eq:sigpfunctional} is non-local and expensive: to evaluate $F(s)[r]$ one must solve Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} on the given $z=s(x,y)$ geometry.

Definition \eqref{eq:sigpfunctional} is a dual pairing of $F(s)$ and $r$, thus roughly an inner product.  VI \eqref{eq:sigpweakform} says that $s$ is located in $\mathcal{K}$, generically on $\partial\mathcal{K}$, at a place where $F(s)$ points directly into $\mathcal{K}$.  Specifically, in geometrical analogy, \eqref{eq:sigpweakform} says that the ``angle'' between $F(s)$ and an arbitrary vector $r-s$ pointing into $\mathcal{K}$ is at most $90^\circ$.

It is well-known that some VIs arise as inequality-constrained minimization problems \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009,KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, but to the best of our knowledge VI \eqref{eq:sigpweakform} does \emph{not} arise in this way.  The general-bed, steady shallow (SIA) model is not a minimization, except in the flat-bed case \cite{JouvetBueler2012}.

The SIGP weak form \eqref{eq:sigpweakform} is coupled to \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} through the definition of the IDO $\Phi$.  The problem therefore has three fundamental nonlinearities:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\emph{\roman{enumi}})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item the Glen power-law rheology,
\item the inequality constraint, and
\item the nonlinearity of free-surface flow reflected in the nonlinearity of the operator $\Phi$.
\end{enumerate}
Regarding (\emph{ii}), observe that even the classical obstacle problem for the linear Laplacian operator is nonlinear \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}.  Regarding (\emph{iii}), note that a free-surface flow for Newtonian (linear) rheology produces a nonlinear equation for the flow thickness, e.g.~as expressed in the kinematic wave equation \cite{Ockendonetal2003}.

To numerically solve \eqref{eq:sigpweakform} we will need the (Gateaux) derivative of $F$, which requires differentiating the $\Phi$ as well.  Suppose $s\in \mathcal{K}$, $\eps>0$, and $t \in W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$ is such that $s+\eps t \in \mathcal{K}$.  (Both $s$ and $s+\eps t$ must be admissible glacier surface elevations.)  From \eqref{eq:sigpfunctional},
\begin{equation}
F'(s)[t,r] = \lim_{\eps\to 0^+} \frac{F(s+\eps t)[r] - F(s)[r]}{\eps} = - \int_\Omega \Phi'(s)[t]\, r \,dx dy \label{eq:sigpfunctionalderiv}
\end{equation}
where by definition
\begin{equation}
\Phi'(s)[t] = \lim_{\eps\to 0^+} \frac{\bu|_{s+\eps t} \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} - \bus \cdot \bn_s}{\eps}. \label{eq:idoderiv}
\end{equation}
In \eqref{eq:idoderiv} note that the normal vectors and surface velocities are extended to the whole of $\Omega$; see \eqref{eq:surfacevelocity}.  We will assume that $\Phi'(s)[t]$ is in the dual space of $W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$ so that \eqref{eq:sigpfunctionalderiv} is finite.  Observe that $F'$ is straightforward to compute from $\Phi'$.

Note $F'(s)[t,r]$ and $\Phi'(s)[t]$ are one-sided directional derivatives in the sense that $s+\eps t$ must be admissible, i.e.~$s+\eps t\ge b$, for all sufficiently-small $\eps>0$, and this clearly requires $t\ge 0$ on the (active) set where $s=b$.  However, to simplify our considerations we define an $s$-independent set
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_+ = \{t \in W^{1,\qq}(\Omega) \,:\, t(x,y) \ge 0\}, \label{eq:infdefectset}
\end{equation}
so $\Phi'(s)[t]$ is well-defined on inputs $(s,t) \in \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{D}_+$ and $F'(s)[t,r]$ is well-defined for $(s,t,r) \in \mathcal{K} \times \mathcal{D}_+ \times W^{1,\qq}(\Omega)$.

We will approximate the true derivative $\Phi'(s)[t]$ by the difference quotient in \eqref{eq:idoderiv}, but only in the situation where $t \in \mathcal{D}_+$ has small support.  (It will be a finite element basis function; see the next section.)  For this it is relevant to say more about the difference, as it depends on whether one is in the support of $t$ or not:
\begin{align*}
\bu|_{s+\eps t} \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} - \bus \cdot \bn_s &= \left(\bu|_{s+\eps t} \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} - \bus \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t}\right) + \left(\bus \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} - \bus \cdot \bn_s\right) \\
    &= \begin{cases}
           (\bu|_{s+\eps t} - \bus) \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} + \eps\, \bus \cdot \left<t_x,t_y,0\right>, & s > b \\
           \bu|_{s+\eps t} \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t}, & s=b \text{ and } t > 0 \\
           0, & s=b \text{ and } t = 0
                 \end{cases}
\end{align*}
Observe that $\bu|_{s+\eps t} \cdot \bn_{s+\eps t} = o(\eps)$ on the ice-free area $s=b$, i.e.~that the dynamical part of the SKE vanishes for small ice masses on bare ground, is a necessary condition for differentiability of $\Phi$.  It is reasonable to suppose this is so when there is no sliding.

In the next three sections we will construct an iterative, multilevel finite element solver for SIGP weak form \eqref{eq:sigpweakform}.  When we approximate the true derivative $\Phi'(s)[t]$ by a difference quotient, a significant issue arises because two Glen-Stokes solutions over the ice domains $\Lambda_{s+\eps t}$ and $\Lambda_s$ are seemingly required.  While this would imply a very large numbers of expensive dynamical solves, in Section \ref{sec:smoothers} we propose a less-expensive approximation.


\section{Finite element discretization} \label{sec:fe}

Assume $\Omega \subset \RR^d$ is polygonal and suppose $\mathcal{T}$ is a triangulation of $\Omega$.  (If $d=1$ then instead $\mathcal{T}$ denotes an interval decomposition of $\Omega$.)  Based on low expected regularity at the ice margin, we will represent surface elevations $s\in \mathcal{K}$ using the $P_1$ finite element (FE) space
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{V}^h = \{s \in C^0(\Omega) : s|_T \text{ is linear if } T \in \mathcal{T}\} \subset W^{1,\qq}(\Omega).
\end{equation}
Note \cite{JouvetBueler2012} makes the same FE choice for the corresponding shallow problem.

Let $b^h \in \mathcal{V}^h$ be the discretized bed elevation, e.g.~the $\mathcal{V}^h$ interpolant of $b$.  From $b^h$ we define the closed and convex admissible subset of $\mathcal{V}^h$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{K}^h = \{r^h \in \mathcal{V}^h \,:\, r^h \ge b^h \text{ and } r^h|_{\partial\Omega} = b^h|_{\partial\Omega}\}.  \label{eq:feK}
\end{equation}
For $s^h\in \mathcal{K}^h$ we also define the numerical icy domain as in \eqref{eq:lambdas}:
\begin{equation}
\Lambda_{s^h} = \{(x,y,z)\,:\,b^h(x,y) < z < s^h(x,y)\} \subset \RR^{d+1}.  \label{eq:felambdas}
\end{equation}
Also, a triangle (interval) $T\in\mathcal{T}$ is said to be ice-free in the $s^h$ geometry if $s^h=b^h$ at every vertex of $T$, and icy otherwise.

Given $s^h$ and $b^h$ from $\mathcal{V}^h$, we construct a Firedrake extruded mesh \cite{McRaeetal2016} to decompose $\Lambda_{s^h}$.  If $d=2$ then the extruded mesh consists of triangular prisms, while if $d=1$ it has quadrilateral elements.  The extruded mesh construction starts from the triangulation $\mathcal{T}$ of $\Omega \subset \RR^d$, now called the ``base mesh''.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:extruded}, each icy $T$ generates a column of $m_z \ge 1$ prism (quadrilateral) elements in the extruded mesh.  However, ice-free $T$ have no extruded mesh elements at all; these columns are empty.

\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{genfigs/extruded.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{We compute $\Phi^h(s^h)$ by solving \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} on an extruded mesh with $m_z$ layers.  In the ``pinched'' extrusion (left), the trace of $\bu^h$ is evaluated on the graph of $s^h$ (bold); see \eqref{eq:ido}.  In the ``cliffs'' extrusion (right) all elements have a minimum thickness and the trace evaluation (bold) may occur above $s^h$ (dotted).}
\label{fig:extruded}
\end{figure}

We will compare two extrusion modes.  In the ``pinched'' extrusion the elements cover $\Lambda_{s^h}$ exactly, prism (quadilateral) elements at the ice margin degenerate; such elements have empty facets.  In the alternate ``cliffs'' extrusion, each element over an icy $T$ is nondegenerate.  Specifically, if $H_{\text{min}} > 0$ is the minimum total thickness, with $H_{\text{min}} = 20$ meters in experiments, then each prism (quadilateral) element has minimum thickness $H_{\text{min}}/m_z$.  In this extrusion, a stress-free condition is applied on the cliffs  in the Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak}; they are treated the same way as the top surface.

Let $\Phi^h:\mathcal{K}^h \to (\mathcal{V}^h)'$ be the FE approximation of the IDO $\Phi$.  By definition $\Phi^h(s^h)$ is the normal component of the numerical surface velocity after solving the Glen-Stokes equation \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} on the domain $\Lambda_{s^h}$.  That is, we evaluate $\Phi^h(s^h)$ using the surface trace as in \eqref{eq:ido}, but on $\overline{\partial} \Lambda_{s^h}$, and then extend by zero to all of $\Omega$.  In the ``cliffs'' extrusion the trace is computed at the top of each column, and thus not necessarily at the original surface $s^h$.

We solve the Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} using a $P^2 \times P^1$ Taylor-Hood mixed space for $(\bu,p)$ \cite{Elmanetal2014}, and a Newton iteration, with direct solution of the step equations and back-tracking line search, to resolve the power-law nonlinearity.  As stated in Section \ref{sec:intro}, note that our goal in the current paper is to show that $O(1)$ iterations of the multilevel scheme (next section) are needed to solve the SIGP \eqref{eq:sigpweakform}.  Overall optimality of the solution algorithm would also need an optimal solution of the Glen-Stokes problem, such as the multigrid scheme in \cite{IsaacStadlerGhattas2015}.

Finally, the discrete SIGP computes $s^h \in \mathcal{K}^h$ satisfying
\begin{equation}
F^h(s^h)[r^h - s^h] \ge \ip{a}{r^h-s^h} \quad \text{for all } r^h \in \mathcal{K}^h , \label{eq:fesigpweakform}
\end{equation}
where $F^h(s)[r] = - \ip{\Phi^h(s)}{r}$; compare \eqref{eq:sigpfunctional}.  We suppose that \eqref{eq:fesigpweakform} is well-posed, but this is subject to the same caveats in the last section regarding identification of Sobolev spaces, along with the concern about overhangs at the margin.


\section{Smoothers} \label{sec:smoothers}

In this section we propose solvers for \eqref{eq:fesigpweakform}.  While they are adequate smoothers in a multilevel method (next section), they converge slowly if used as single-level methods.  We will describe both projected nonlinear Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods \cite{KinderlehrerStampacchia1980}, but only implement the latter.

To describe these methods suppose $(x_i,y_i)$ denotes an arbitrary vertex of $\mathcal{T}$, and $\psi_i \in \mathcal{V}^h$ the corresponding hat function, i.e.~such that $\psi_i(x_j,y_j)=\delta_{ij}$ \cite{Elmanetal2014}.  Also let
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}_+^h = \{t^h \in \mathcal{V}^h \,:\, t^h \ge 0\}.  \label{eq:feDplus}
\end{equation}
Note that, because $\psi_i \in \mathcal{D}_+^h$, if $r^h \in \mathcal{K}^h$ then $r + c \psi_i \in \mathcal{K}^h$ for all $c\ge \omega_i^s$ where $\omega_i^{s^h} = b^h(x_i,y_i) - s^h(x_i,y_i)$.

Given a current surface elevation $s^h\in \mathcal{K}^h$, a smoother will sweep through the nodes in a fixed order, solving one-dimensional VI problems and then updating $s^h$.  The one-dimensional VI at node $i$, derived from \eqref{eq:fesigpweakform}, finds $c \ge \omega_i^{s^h}$ such that
\begin{equation}
F^h(s^h+c\psi_i)[(s^h+\gamma \psi_i) - (s^h+c \psi_i)] \ge \ip{a}{(s^h+\gamma \psi_i) - (s^h+c \psi_i)} \label{eq:fepointwiseviEARLY}
\end{equation}
for all $\gamma \ge \omega_i^{s^h}$.  Let
\begin{equation}
\rho_i(s^h; c) = F^h(s^h+c\psi_i)[\psi_i] - \ip{a}{\psi_i}, \label{eq:ferhoi}
\end{equation}
a point-wise residual function.  Then \eqref{eq:fepointwiseviEARLY} is equivalent to the simplified form
\begin{equation}
(\gamma - c) \,\rho_i(s^h; c) \ge 0. \label{eq:fepointwisevi}
\end{equation}
Supposing \eqref{eq:fepointwisevi} is well-posed and solved for $c$, the surface elevation $s^h$ is then updated $s^h \gets s^h + c \psi_i$ by the smoother.  Observe that admissibility is preserved: the updated surface elevation is also in $\mathcal{K}^h$.

Each pointwise update is done immediately by the (serial) Gauss-Seidel smoother, while the (parallel) Jacobi smoother computes solutions to \eqref{eq:fepointwisevi} at all nodes $i$ before then doing all the updates.  In linear problems it is known that Gauss-Seidel generally converges in about half as many iterations \cite{Greenbaum1997}, but here there is a more glaring difference between the two iterations.  Gauss-Seidel would be an extraordinarily expensive approach because a new Glen-Stokes solution would be required at every node of $\mathcal{T}$.  We will prefer the Jacobi strategy; see below.

FIXME If $F_p^h(c)$ were linear and increasing then the solution of \eqref{eq:fepointwisevi} would be given by a simple formula \cite{GraeserKornhuber2009}, namely $c = \max\left\{-\beta/\alpha, \omega_p^s\right\}$ if $F_p^h(c) = \alpha c + \beta$ with $\alpha > 0$, but in fact $F_p^h(c)$ is nonlinear.  The simplest approximation scheme is thus to linearize $F_p^h(c)$, that is, smooth using one projected Newton step for the one-dimensional VI problem at each node.  To implement this strategy, note that \eqref{eq:sigpfunctionalderiv} and \eqref{eq:idoderiv} imply
\begin{equation}
F_p^h(c) = F^h(s+c\psi_p)[\psi_p] \approx F^h(s)[\psi_p] + c\, (F^h)'(s,\psi_p)[\psi_p] = \alpha c + \beta \label{eq:fepointwisefunctionalapprox}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align}
\alpha &= \int_\Omega \left(- \left(\lim_{\eps\to 0^+} \frac{\bu^h|_{s+\eps \psi_p} - \bu^h|_s}{\eps}\right) \cdot \bn_s + \Phi^h(s) \cdot \left<(\psi_p)_x,(\psi_p)_y,0\right>\right)\, \psi_p \,dx dy \label{eq:fepointwisealpha} \\
\beta &= - \int_\Omega (\Phi^h(s) + a)\, \psi_p \,dx dy \label{eq:fepointwisebeta}
\end{align}
Each smoother application will require at least one solution of the Glen-Stokes problem \eqref{eq:glenstokesweak} on the geometry determined by the current surface elevation.  In fact, supposing we have computed $\bu^h|_s$ and $\Phi^h(s)$ then several terms in these formulas are straightforward FE computations over the support of $\psi_p$.

However, if we wish to compute $\alpha$ in \eqref{eq:fepointwisealpha}, even approximately, then it remains to compute a difference quotient in \eqref{eq:fepointwisealpha}, which in turn requires evaluating a perturbed-geometry surface velocity $\bu^h|_{s+\eps \psi_p}$.  The expensive direct way of doing this is to solve a Glen-Stokes problem for the perturbed upper-surface geometry $z=s + \eps \psi_p$.

Thus we seek a less expensive way to estimate the perturbed velocity field for a small ``bump'' $\eps\psi_p$ added to the surface elevation $s$.  For small $\eps$ the nonlinearities of the Glen-Stokes problem should be modest, but furthermore the most important change to the velocity and pressure fields from this bump would be through the perturbed gravitational load of the ice in the bump.  Thus FIXME
