# multilevel-stokes-geometry

This is a project to apply the multilevel constraint decomposition method, using Stokes dynamics, to compute the geometry of glaciers.  Earlier development of this project occurred in the [mg-glaciers](https://github.com/bueler/mg-glaciers) repository, but this has been split out.
